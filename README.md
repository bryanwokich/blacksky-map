# Bryan Wokich's Take Home Project
Thanks for taking the time to review my project.  I found the DeckGL library to be
a fun library to play with. There is definitely a lot of improvements that could be
made to this little application, but I figured I shouldn't expand scope too much
beyond the initial request.

Have a wonderful day!
Bryan
